          <h1> Hi! I'm Elaine</h1>
            <p id="intro">I'm a <span>Responsive designer and developer </span> who thrive on visual story telling. When I'm not working, or pursuing on side projects, I can be found traveling, hiking, taking nature photograph and searching for new stories.
          <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="div-1" id="about">
                <p> I was born and raised in <span>Southease Asia</span> in small country named Vietnam, sent over to US for 10 years ago with faith of living American dream. I owe my travel bug to be a first Asian American with family all over the world - we were always on the go! Living in PNW gives me just the right chances to explore my traveling passion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2" id="passion">
                <p><strong>My passion:</strong> I love art and music, and have great curiosity about how things come to existence. To me, music and art are one of the most powerful and diverse methods of expresion and communication. In my sparetime, I get my fix by going to a lots and lots of concerts, art museums and exhibits. I'm at 111 and still counting.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3" id="fun-fact">
                <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> As a true Southeast Asian citizen, I'm kinda proud to say that I only learned how to ride anything coming in two-wheels. Yes, you got it: a moped and plain ol' bike, and have yet leant to drive. But, the real takeway is that I'm learning and a true work-in-progress.</p>
